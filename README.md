Code and raw data to accompany publication

This repository provides the code and raw data used to generate results for the following paper: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-3425337/v1

All statistical analysis was performed using R version 4.2.1 (2022-06-23 ucrt), R packages pROC (1.18.0), survival (3.3-1), survminer (0.4.9), and SPSS 27. 

Here we provide data as Z-scores, which were produced from the concentration of each biomarker (CSF and serum) to allow all their model coefficients to be directly compared. Z-scores were generated by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation for all the valid data for each biomarker.
